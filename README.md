## Introduction

Pivotal Token Search is designed to enhance the way we interact with large language models (LLMs). By utilizing direct preference optimization (DPO) and other innovative methods, PTS allows users to generate high-quality datasets that improve LLM performance. The project integrates various techniques such as sparse autoencoders and steering vectors, making it a robust solution for your data generation needs.

## Features

- **Dataset Generation**: Create diverse datasets tailored to your specific needs.
- **Direct Preference Optimization**: Optimize model outputs based on user preferences.
- **LLM Inference**: Leverage large language models for various applications.
- **Steering Vectors**: Use steering vectors to guide model behavior effectively.
- **Integration with Phi4**: Enhance model performance using Phi4 techniques.
- **Sparse Autoencoders**: Utilize sparse autoencoders for efficient data representation.
